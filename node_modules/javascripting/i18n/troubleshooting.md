## Additional troubleshooting:
 * Did you type the name of the file correctly? You can check by running ls `%filename%`, if you see ls: cannot access `%filename%`: No such file or directory then you should create new file / rename existing or change directories to the one with file
 * Make sure you didn't omit parens, since otherwise compiler would not be able to parse it
 * Make sure you didn't do any typos in the string itself
