Numbers can be integers, like `2`, `14`, or `4353`, or they can be decimals,  
also known as floats, like `3.14`, `1.5`, or `100.7893423`.
Unlike Strings, Numbers do not need to have quotes.

## The challenge:

Create a file named `numbers.js`.

In that file define a variable named `example` that references the integer `123456789`.

Use `console.log()` to print that number to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify numbers.js`
